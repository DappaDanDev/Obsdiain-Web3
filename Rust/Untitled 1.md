**Junior Blockchain Developer ( Graduates welcome)**

**Job Description**

**About OnFinality & SubQuery**

OnFinality is an organisation dedicated to providing key infrastructure services to the Blockchain community. OnFinality, and its child projects SubQuery and Aoraki, is a small but growing organisation based in Auckland providing services to the world. 

OnFinality’s aim is to support growing teams with infrastructure and API services. We provide easy to use infrastructure automation tools to reduce the amount of time development teams need to spend managing and deploying infrastructure. We also provide free mission-critical public services to various networks via our API service (providing over 50 million API requests each day).

SubQuery is all about making the world’s decentralised data more accessible. Every team needs to process and query decentralised data - historically this data is in a format that makes it difficult to read. We transform and save this data to make it easier and faster to allow it to be used in more complex applications.

_We’re all about helping others create new products that will help us transition to the web3 future._
